# hwbuddy
Hack NC 2016

This is a program built with a team of 4 people in a university hackathon. 

The main goal of this project was to be able to take an audio recording of a lecture, translate it into text, and then summarize that text into a one page summary. Essentially creating a "Sparknotes" for lectures.

To build this, we used python, flask, php, javascript, and the IBM Watson API (for summarization).

To download the project, simply download the zip from github or run this command in the command line:

<code>git pull https://github.com/zhughes3/hwbuddy.git master</code>
